Lieveheersbeestje Photoshop Actions V9 (V=Version)

Please read the following lines thoroughly.
* The actions are created with Photoshop CS2 and should be used with Photoshop CS versions only, I don't recommend other programs. These should work properly with CS2 or higher (tested with CS2 and CS6 Extended).
* Now you have downloaded these, you can install it and use it with Photoshop.

* Credit me if you use one or more of my actions, I would greatly appreciate it. Link back to http://lieveheersbeestje.org or http://lieveheersbeestje.deviantart.com
